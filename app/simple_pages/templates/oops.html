    <h1>OOP Terms and Definitions</h1>
    <h4>Instantiation</h4>
    <p>
        Instantiation in computer science refers to the creation of an object (or an “instance” of a given class) in an
        object-oriented programming (OOP) language. Referencing a class declaration, an instantiated object is named and
        created, in memory or on disk. In the calculator test python file, the calculator class is being instantiated in
        “calculator = Calculator()”. Instantiation allows you to create as many calculators as you want with different
        properties.
    </p>

    <h4>Object</h4>
    <p>
        An abstract data type created by a developer. It can include multiple properties and methods and may even
        contain other objects.An object is a specific instance of a class; it contains real values instead of variables.
    </p>

    <h4>Class</h4>
    <p>
        A class is a blueprint that defines the variables and the methods common to all objects of a certain kind.
    </p>

    <h4>Namespace</h4>
    <p>
        A set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. Namespaces ensure that
        all of a
        given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified.
    </p>

    <h4>Constructor</h4>
    <p>
        A special method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that initializes a newly created object
        of that type.
    </p>

    <h4>Fixture</h4>
    <p>
        Fixtures is a fancy word for sample data. Fixtures allow you to populate your testing database with predefined
        data before your tests run. Fixtures are database independent and written in YAML.
    </p>

    <h4>Type hint</h4>
    <p>
        A formal solution to statically indicate the type of a value. Type hints will help document your code. And
        notice the idea of hints—they have no runtime effect, they're only hints and are not enforced on their own.
    </p>

    <h4>Type cast</h4>
    <p>
        Typecast is a way of changing an object from one data type to the next. It is used in computer programming to
        ensure a function handles the variables correctly. A typecast example is the transformation of an integer into a
        string.
    </p>

    <h4>Unit test</h4>
    <p>
        Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called
        units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation.
    </p>

    <h4>Static</h4>
    <p>
        Static is another term used to describe constant. For example, many web pages are static web pages HTML pages,
        which means none of the content being displayed was generated by other code or a script. Static pages do not
        change unless the creator manually makes a change to the file.
    </p>

    <h4>Instance method</h4>
    <p>
        An instance method is a method that belongs to instances of a class, not to the class itself. To define an
        instance method, just omit static from the method heading. Within the method definition, you refer to variables
        and methods in the class by their names, without a dot.
    </p>

    <h4>Instance property</h4>
    <p>
        An instance property applies to a specific system server. When you create both a global value and an instance
        value for the same property, the instance value takes precedence.
    </p>

    <h4>Static method</h4>
    <p>
        Static methods are the methods in Java that can be called without creating an object of class. They are
        referenced by the class name itself or reference to the Object of that class.
    </p>

    <h4>Static property</h4>
    <p>
        A static property or method acts somewhat like a globally accessible function or variable. Simply import the
        class, and you can read the same value from anywhere else in the program.
    </p>

    <h4>Encapsulation</h4>
    <p>
        The bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit. Many programming
        languages use encapsulation frequently in the form of classes.
    </p>

    <h4>Inheritance</h4>
    <p>
        An OOP technique that allows one class to inherit the attributes and methods of another class. In an inheritance
        relationship, the parent class can also be referred to as the superclass or base class. The child class can be
        referred to as the subclass or derived class.
    </p>

    <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
    <p>
        A feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows a specific routine to use variables of different
        types at different times. Polymorphism is the ability of a programming language to present the same interface
        for several different underlying data types.
    </p>

    <h4>Abstraction</h4>
    <p>
        Abstraction is one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. It involves filtering out or ignoring the
        characteristics that we don't need in order to concentrate on those that we do.
    </p>

    <h4>Overview of SOLID</h4>
    <p>
        SOLID stands for:<br>
        S - Single-responsiblity Principle: A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class
        should have only one job.<br>
        O - Open-closed Principle: Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.<br>
        L - Liskov Substitution Principle: Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y)
        should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.<br>
        I - Interface Segregation Principle: A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t
        use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.<br>
        D - Dependency Inversion Principle: Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the
        high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.<br>
    </p>

    <h4>Overview of Design Patterns</h4>
    <p>
        In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in
        software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a
        description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
