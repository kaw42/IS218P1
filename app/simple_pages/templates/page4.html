     <p>Shintaro Tsuji founded Sanrio on August 10, 1960, then known as the Yamanashi Silk Company using Â¥1,000,000 in
        capital. In 1962, Tsuji expanded his enterprise from silk to rubber sandals with flowers painted on them. Tsuji
        noticed his success gained by merely adding a cute design to the sandals.
