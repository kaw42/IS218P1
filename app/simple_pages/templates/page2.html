    <h1>About Docker</h1>
    <p class="makeBigger">
        Docker is an open source containerization platform and application build and deployment tool. It is an open
        platform for developing, shipping, and running applications through containers.
    </p>
    <h4>What are containers?</h4>
    <p>
        A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application
        runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
    </p>

    <h4>What are images?</h4>
    <p>
        An image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an
        application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
