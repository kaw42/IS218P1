    <h1>About Docker</h1>
    <p class="makeBigger">
        Docker is an open source containerization platform and application build and deployment tool. It is an open
        platform for developing, shipping, and running applications through containers.
    </p>
    <h4>What are containers?</h4>
    <p>
        A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application
        runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
    </p>

    <h4>What are images?</h4>
    <p>
        An image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an
        application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

    <h4>Docker Commands</h4>
    docker build = Build an image from a Dockerfile <br>
    docker commit = Create a new image from a container’s changes <br>
    docker container = manage containers <br>
    docker kill = kill running containers <br>
    docker push = push an image or repo to a registry <br>
    docker rm = remove containers <br>
    docker run = run a command in a new container <br>
    </p>
    <h4>How to start the project and access the container with the terminal</h4>
    <p>
        Open a terminal and go to the app directory with your docker file. You can build a container using the docker
        "build" command. ex.) docker build -t container-name. This command uses the docker file to build a new container image and the
        "-t" flag tags your image. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        To access the container, you have to use the "docker run" command. ex.) docker run -dp 3000:3000 container_name.
        The 3000:3000 means you are creating a mapping between the host’s port 3000 to the container’s port 3000. Now
        when you go to your browser and enter http://localhost:3000, you should be able to see your app.
