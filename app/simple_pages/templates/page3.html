    <h1>About Python</h1>
    <p>
        Python is a high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its
        high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive
        for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing
        components together.

    <h4>Testing with pytest and examples</h4> 
    <p>
        Pytest is a testing framework based on python. For the most part, it is used to write application programming
        interface (API) test cases. It helps to write both simple and complex unit and functional tests. For example, in
        this project, I had to use pytest when testing that my base.html and context_process_test.py matched. I had
        several failures but mostly successes. After editing my code and running pytest again, it became all passes.
    </p>

    <h4>How I created simple pages and how I tested it</h4>
    <p>
        I created simple pages by extending my base.html to each file in order to include the nav bar. I then changed
        the names of each page from pages 1, 2, 3, and 4 to Git, Docker, Python/Flask, and CI/CD. I went back to my
        base.html and changed these to reflect the names on the nav bar. Lastly, wrote my own code for each individual
        page and made sure it ran successfully. To test simple pages, I ran pytest for simple_pages_test.py and made any
        necessary edits to have all passes and 0 failures.
